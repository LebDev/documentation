# Editor Bookmarks

To easily navigate in large files you can use Editor bookmarks. Cmd+F2 (default shortcut) will add a new bookmark on the editor. The bookmark is tied to the line so if you use the move line up/down commands it will move the bookmark as well. To cycle through your bookmarks just hit F2.

Bookmarks shortcuts:

- Toggle bookmark (Cmd-F2)
- Jump to next bookmark (F2)
- Jump to previous bookmark (Shift-F2)
- Clear bookmarks (Shift-Cmd-F2)

All shortcuts can be changed using [Key Binding Preferences](../preferences/commandsandkeybindings.html)
